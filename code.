function blockWebsite(url) {
  // Check if the website is already blocked
  if (!localStorage.getItem(url)) {
    // Block the website by adding it to the local storage
    localStorage.setItem(url, true);
    console.log(`${url} has been blocked.`);
  } else {
    console.log(`${url} is already blocked.`);
  }
}


You can call this function by passing in the URL of the website you want to block, like so:


blockWebsite("https://www.example.com");


This function uses the localStorage API to store the blocked websites. The website is added to the local storage if it's not already blocked and a message is displayed in the console. If the website is already blocked, a message is displayed in the console.

You can also unblock a website by calling :
localStorage.removeItem(url)
